# Advent of Code 2021

This is my attempts at the Advent of Code 2021 challenges.

My goal is to use TypeScript, which is a new language for me. I will document the process of beginning with TS here.

Installed TS via npm as a local development dependency:

    `npm install typescript --save-dev`

> Alternatively, we could install globally with `npm install typescript -g`.  Installing locally requires using `npx tsc` instead of just `tsc` in the terminal.

A default tsconfig.json is created with:

    `tsc --init`

TS files can be compiled to JS with:

    `tsc sample.ts`
